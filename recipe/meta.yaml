  summary: Ensemble Toolkit (EnTK) is an ensemble execution system written in Python
  description: |
    Ensemble Toolkit is a Python framework for developing and executing applications comprised of 
    multiple sets of tasks, aka ensembles. Ensemble Toolkit has the following unique features, (i) 
    abstractions that enable the expression of various task graphs, (ii) abstraction of resource 
    management and task execution, (iii) Fault tolerance as a first order concern and (iv) 
    well-established runtime capabilities to enable efficient and dynamic usage of grid resources 
    and supercomputers.
