  summary: RADICAL-EnTK is an ensemble execution system written in Python
  description: |
    RADICAL-EnTK (Ensemble Toolkit) is a Python framework for developing and 
    executing applications comprised of multiple sets of tasks, aka ensembles. 
    Ensemble Toolkit has the following unique features, (i) abstractions that 
    enable the expression of various task graphs, (ii) abstraction of resource 
    management and task execution, (iii) Fault tolerance as a first order 
    concern and (iv) well-established runtime capabilities to enable efficient 
    and dynamic usage of grid resources and supercomputers.
